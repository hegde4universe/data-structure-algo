Stack , what is it?
Stack is one-ended linear data structure which models real-world stack by having two primary operations push and pop

##operations all O(1)
push() to insert an element into the stack
pop() returns top element and removes it from the stack
peek() Returns the top element of the stack(without removing it)
isEmpty() returns true is stack is empty else false
size() returns the size of stack
search() - returns how far/distance of element

##use cases?
Infix to Postfix /Prefix conversion, compiler syntax, matching braces and brackets
Redo-undo features at many places like editors, photoshop.
Forward and backward features in web browsers
Used in many algorithms like Tower of Hanoi, tree traversals, stock span problems, and histogram problems.
Recursion keeping track of previous method calls
String reversal is also another application of stack. Here one by one each character gets inserted into the stack

##There are two ways to implement a stack
Using array
Using linked list

##Algorithm for push:
begin
 if stack is full
    return
 endif
else
 increment top
 stack[top] assign value
end else
end procedure

##Algorithm for pop:
begin
 if stack is empty
    return
 endif
else
 store value of stack[top]
 decrement top
 return value
end else
end procedure
